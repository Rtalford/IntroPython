# 1. Use built in print function to display strings

# '''


# # Print Hello World
print('Hello World')
 

# # Print What a wonderful day
print('What a wonderful day')

 # Print Today is Wednesday


# Print Onward and upward


# Print This year really flew by


'''

2. create snake-cased descriptive variable names, than print

'''

# car color equal to blue
car_color = 'blue'
print(car_color)
 

# favorite ice cream equal to strawberry
favorite_icecream = 'strawberry'
print(favorite_icecream)

# first name equal to your first name
first_name = 'Florence'
fname = 'Florence'
print(fname)

# system password equal to nevada12
password = 'nevada12'
print(password)
 
# favorite food equal to pizza
favorite_food = 'pizza'
print(favorite_food)

'''

3. Use arithmetic operators (PEMDAS) What does PEMDAS stand for? Parenthesis, exponents,
multiply, divide, add subtract.

'''

# In a variable called 'result' solve (2 + 5) * 6, than print.
result = (2 + 5) * 6
print(result)

# In the variable called 'answer' solve 5 + 4 * 3, than print
answer = 5 + 4 * 3 
print(answer)
 
# in a variable called birth year, assign your year of birth. In a variable called current year,
birth_year = 1986
current_year = 2023

# assign the current year.  create a variable for 'age  in a decade'  which subtracts your birth
age_in_a_decade = (current_year - birth_year) + 10

# year from the current year, and adds ten, print the result
print(age_in_a_decade)
 

'''

4. calculate based on an equation that utilizes pemdas, utlize f strings to display good output

for the user

 

'''

 

# Circumference of a circle,  C=2Ï€r, lets import the math module and try something new,

# math.pi for pi, solve for radius being 3, than print

import math 

radius = 3
circumference_of_a_circle = 2 * math.pi * radius
print(f'The circumference of the circle with a radius of {radius} is {circumference_of_a_circle: .2f}')

# average of 3 test scores (95, 82, 90), the old-fashioned way so we can manually utilize PEMDAS

# use variables for every value, than print
test_1 = 95
test_2 = 82
test_3 = 90

test_average = (test_1 + test_2 + test_3)/3
print(f'Congratulations the average of your test scores are {test_average}')

test_average = (test_1 + test_2 + test_3)

'''

5. Identify datatypes (bool, Int, Float, Strings) - type function

'''

# dog_name = 'fido'
dog_name = 'fido'
print(type(dog_name))

# age = 27
age = 27
print(type(age))

# weather_is_hot = True
weather_is_hot = True
print(type(weather_is_hot))

# average_weight = 165.23
average_weight = 165.23
print(type(average_weight))
 
# last_name = 'jenkins'
last_name = 'jenkins'
print(type(last_name))
 
# phrase_of_the_week = 'I love coding!'
phrase_of_the_week = 'I love coding!'
print(type(phrase_of_the_week))
 
# is_logged_in = False


# temp_f = 74

 

# scores = [75, 45, 23, 99]

 

# my_vals = {'heart', 12, 'mazda', 'springtime'}

 

# my_dog = {

#     "size":"small",

#     "appetite": "big"

# }

'''

6. Shortcut operators

'''

# num_one is assigned value of 6, using shortcut operator, subtract 3
num_one = 6 
num_one -= 3
print(num_one)

# num_two is assigned value of 10, using shortcut operator, add 2
num_two = 10
num_two += 2
print(num_two)

# num_three is assigned value of 12, using shortcut operator, divide by 2.5
num_three = 12
num_three /= 2.5
print(num_three)
 
# num_four is assigned value of 3, using shortcut operator, add 12
num_four = 3
num_four += 12
print(num_four)

# num_five is assigned value of 8, using shortcut operator, multiply 2

num_five = 8
num_five *= 2
print(num_five)
'''

7. Boolean operators - Print results

'''

# Is 5 is less than 7?
result = 5 < 7
print(f'Is 5 less than 7? {result}')

# Is 16 divided by 2 equal to 8?
result = (16 / 2) == 8
print(f'Is 16 divided by 2 equal to 8? {result}')
 
# Is 12 greater than 19?

 
# Variable ice_cream_tasty is set to True. Apply 'not' and print the new result
ice_cream_tasty = True
print (not ice_cream_tasty)
 
# ice_cream_tasty_too != False  #work on this one 
# print(ice_cream_tasty_too)

# Set the variable food to spaghetti. Using the boolean operator 'in', is there a letter g in

# spaghetti? Is there a letter z in spaghetti?
food = 'spaghetti'
print('z' in food)
print('g' in food)
 

# Is the string dog not equal to cat?

 

'''

8. Strings

'''

# assign your first name to a variable, assign your last name to a variable, concatenate them to
# a new variable called full_name, include an additional string for the space in between

firstname = 'Thelma'
lastname = 'John'
fullname = firstname + lastname
print(fullname)

firstname = 'Thelma'
lastname = 'John'
fullname = firstname + ' ' + lastname
print(fullname)

# Store the string 'Saturday' in a variable called, 'day'. Multiply it so that appears 4 times in
# a new variable

day = 'Saturday'
fav_day = day * 4

day = 'Saturday  '
fav_day = day * 4
print(fav_day)

# store the length of the string 'peanut butter" in variable my_food

# print the values 1 through 5 and separate each number with an asterisk, using sep parameter

print(1,2,3,4,5, sep="*")

# Two print statements, "Lets" and "Party", use the end parameter to create a space between the
# two. Test the newline and tab escape characters with these print statements

print("Lets", end=" ")
print("Party")
'''

Conditionals

'''

# If the variable myname is equal to the string version of your first name, let's print,
# and tell ourselves hello with a formatted string

myname = 'Reynelle' 

if myname == 'Reynelle':
  print(f'Hello {myname}')

  print(f'{current_year} is an odd year')
else: 
  print(f'{current_year} is an even year') 

# lets set a variable good_weather to false. If this is false, lets print grab an umbrella. In

# the else let's say, no jacket needed. Change variable to true and lets see the new result

 

# lets set a variable gas tank to 30. If gas tank is less than or equal to 30 let's print "Get

# Gas" otherwise we will print,no gas needed

'''

10. For & While Loops

'''

 

# Lets write a while loop, using a counter that will print Happy Halloween 5 times

counter = 0 #initialization

while counter <= 10: #condition
  print("Happy Halloween", counter)
  counter += 1 #update / increment/ decrement

 # Lets write a while loop that will count from 1 to 10

# counter = 1 # initialization 

# while counter <= 10: #condition 
#   print(counter)
#   counter += 1 

i = 0 #initializing 
while i <= 10:
  print(i)
  i += 1  #increment

i = 0 #initializing 
while i <= 10:
  print(i)
  i += 5  #increment

# Lets write a loop that will take user input, and keep prompting for the input until the user adds that input
