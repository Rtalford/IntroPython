# 1. Use built in print function to display strings

# '''

 

# # Print Hello World

 

# # Print What a wonderful day

 

# # Print Today is Wednesday

 

# # Print Onward and upward

 

# # Print This year really flew by

 

# '''

# 2. create snake-cased descriptive variable names, than print

# '''

 

# # car color equal to blue

 

# # favorite ice cream equal to strawberry

 

# # first name equal to your first name

 

# # system password equal to nevada12

 

# # favorite food equal to pizza

 

# '''

# 3. Use arithmetic operators (PEMDAS) What does PEMDAS stand for? Parenthesis, exponents,

# multiply, divide, add subtract.

# '''

 

# # In a variable called 'result' solve (2 + 5) * 6, than print.

 

# # In the variable called 'answer' solve 5 + 4 * 3, than print

 

# # in a variable called birth year, assign your year of birth. In a variable called current year,

# # assign the current year.  create a variable for 'age  in a decade'  which subtracts your birth

# # year from the current year, and adds ten, print the result

 

# '''

# 4. calculate based on an equation that utilizes pemdas, utlize f strings to display good output

# for the user

 

# '''

 

# # Circumference of a circle,  C=2Ï€r, lets import the math module and try something new,

# # math.pi for pi, solve for radius being 3, than print

 

# # average of 3 test scores (95, 82, 90), the old-fashioned way so we can manually utilize PEMDAS

# # use variables for every value, than print

 

# '''

# 5. Identify datatypes (bool, Int, Float, Strings) - type function

# '''

 

# # dog_name = 'fido'

 

# # age = 27

 

# # weather_is_hot = True

 

# # average_weight = 165.23

 

# # last_name = 'jenkins'

 

# # phrase_of_the_week = 'I love coding!'

 

# # is_logged_in = False

 

# # temp_f = 74

 

# # scores = [75, 45, 23, 99]

 

# # my_vals = {'heart', 12, 'mazda', 'springtime'}

 

# # my_dog = {

# #     "size":"small",

# #     "appetite": "big"

# # }

 

# '''

# 6. Shortcut operators

# '''

 

# # num_one is assigned value of 6, using shortcut operator, subtract 3

 

# # num_two is assigned value of 10, using shortcut operator, add 2

 

# # num_three is assigned value of 12, using shortcut operator, divide by 2.5

 

# # num_four is assigned value of 3, using shortcut operator, add 12

 

# # num_five is assigned value of 8, using shortcut operator, multiply 2

 

# '''

# 7. Boolean operators - Print results

# '''

 

# # Is 5 is less than 7?

 

# # Is 16 divided by 2 equal to 8?

 

# # Is 12 greater than 19?

 

# # Variable ice_cream_tasty is set to True. Apply 'not' and print the new result

 

# # Set the variable food to spaghetti. Using the boolean operator 'in', is there a letter g in

# # spaghetti? Is there a letter z in spaghetti?

 

# # Is the string dog not equal to cat?

 

# '''

# 8. Strings

# '''

# # assign your first name to a variable, assign your last name to a variable, concatenate them to

# # a new variable called full_name, include an additional string for the space in between

 

# # Store the string 'Saturday' in a variable called, 'day'. Multiply it so that appears 4 times in

# # a new variable

 

# # store the length of the string 'peanut butter" in variable my_food

 

# # store the length of the string 'coffee' in variable my_drink

 

# # apply capitalize to 'hello', reassign to new variable

 

# # apply upper to 'chair', reassign to new variable

 

# # Use isupper to test 'AMAZING'

 

# # Use istitle to test 'welcome to earth"

 

# # apply count to the letter b on the string baseball

 

# # apply find to the letter g to grapes

 

# # apply index to the letter y to crayon

 

# '''

# 9. User Input & misc

# '''

# # Ask user for their age, cast to a int, check the type

 

# # Ask user for first name, Ask user for last name, output "Your name is  " and include the

# # concatenated output in a formatted string

 

# # ask the user for 2 numbers, multiply the two numbers and show the user output in formatted string

 

# # Pull the first 4 characters from the string burger, assign to a variable food

 

# # Pull the last 3 characters from the string couch, assign to variable furniture

 

# # Assign the string "Apple Pie" to variable dessert. Create and print a new string that captures

# # every other letter in the string dessert

 

# # Reverse the string dodgeball and assign it to variable game

 

# # print the values 1 through 5 and separate each number with an asterisk, using sep parameter

 

# # Two print statements, "Lets" and "Party", use the end parameter to create a space between the

# # two. Test the newline and tab escape characters with these print statements

 

# '''

# Conditionals

# '''

 

# # If the variable myname is equal to the string version of your first name, let's print,

# # and tell ourselves hello with a formatted string

 

# # if our current year is an odd number, let's print in a formatted string that the current year

# # is an odd number

 

# # lets set a variable good_weather to false. If this is false, lets print grab an umbrella. In

# # the else let's say, no jacket needed. Change variable to true and lets see the new result

 

# # lets set a variable gas tank to 30. If gas tank is less than or equal to 30 let's print "Get

# # Gas" otherwise we will print,no gas needed

# '''

# 10. For & While Loops

# '''

 

# # Lets write a while loop, using a counter that will print Happy Halloween 5 times

 

# # Lets write a while loop that will count from 1 to 10

 

# # Lets write a loop that will take user input, and keep prompting for the input until the user adds that input
