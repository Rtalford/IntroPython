Loops
1. While loops - Run as long as a given condition is true
2. Example - Create a while loop that prints every integer from 1 to 10
3. Create a while loop that will keep asking a user for their user id, until they type 'stop'.
4. Improved login system - Rewrite the username and login program. If the user enters the
incorrect username or login, they will keep receiving a prompt.
5. For Loops - Iterate through strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets....
'for item in collection'
6. Write a loop that loops through a string, counts all the letters, and then print how long the
string is.
7. Take a string from the user, verify that it's a number. Write a loop that adds all the digits
together, then print the total.
8. Adding conditionals to loops - Write some code that will loop through a string and print
whether each letter is a vowel or a consonant.
9. You’re working on a data analysis project for a company that looks at written text. You’re only interested in letters from A-Z because you’re analyzing language. However, the data you’re given has some values that shouldn’t be there.
Write a Python program that takes a string as input from the user, removes anything from the string that isn’t a letter, and prints the new string.
You can loop through the string in a for loop, use the .isalpha() string method, and remember that strings are immutable, so you will have to build a new string from scratch using string concatenation.
