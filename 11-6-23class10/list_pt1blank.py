# 1. Accessing lists with indexing
# '''

# # Assign the value of earth to a variable using indexing

# planets = ['venus', 'mercury', 'mars', 'earth']


# # Assign the value of strawberry to a variable using indexing

# ice_cream = ['chocolate', 'strawberry', 'vanilla']

# # Assign the value of bike to a variable using indexing

# transportation = ['bus', 'car', 'bike']


# # Assign the value of green to a variable using indexing

# colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue']

# # Assign the value of 2.91 to a variable using indexing

# mixed_data_types = [3, 2.91, 'yarn']



# '''
# 2. Updating lists with indexing
# '''

# # Update the value of earth to a jupiter using indexing

# # planets = ['venus', 'mercury', 'mars', 'earth']

# # Update the value of strawberry to mint chocolate chip using indexing

# # ice_cream = ['chocolate', 'strawberry', 'vanilla']

# # Update the value of bike to motorcycle using indexing

# # transportation = ['bus', 'car', 'bike']

# # Update the value of green to orange to a variable using indexing

# # colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue']


# # Update the value of 2.91 to elephant using indexing

# # mixed_data_types = [3, 2.91, 'yarn']


# '''
# 3. Lists in a For Loop
# '''

# # Lets loop through and display the results

# # my_nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# '''
# Create a for loop that goes through this list and prints each item in the list, along with its 
# index. (Hint: Create a separate counter variable to keep track of the index.)

# Example:
# planets = ["mercury", "venus", "earth", "mars"]
# 0: mercury, 1: venus, 2: earth, 3: mars

# '''



# '''
# 4. Exercise
# Write some code that takes one list and creates a second list that has the type for each entry in 
# the list. Hint: Use the type() function and a for loop

# Optional:
# Make sure you filter out any repeats.

# '''

# # # Original list

# data = ['fido', 'fido', 'caravan', 'caravan', 10, 10, False, 8.12, ['hello', 'everyone'], ['leg']]

# # list with no duplicates
# no_duplicates = []

# #Filtered list
# filtered_list = []

# # remove dupes 
# for d in data:
#   if d not in no_duplicates:
#     no_duplicates.append(d)
# print(no_duplicates)

# #Type for each entry
# for e in no_duplicates:
#   filtered_list.append(type(e))
# print(filtered_list)

# '''
# Remove Dupes
# This for loop will start appending items to our no dupes list. As we loop through, we will not 
# add any additional items into no dupes that already exist there
# '''

# '''
# Type for each entry
# We will now take our no dupes list and loop through, capture the types and append them to our final
# list
# '''


# '''
# 5. List methods
# append() Adds an element at the end of the list
# clear() Removes all the elements from the list
# copy() Returns a copy of the list
# count() Returns the number of elements with the specified value
# extend() Add the elements of a list (or any iterable), to the end of the current list
# index() Returns the index of the first element with the specified value
# insert() Adds an element at the specified position
# pop() Removes the element at the specified position
# remove() Removes the first item with the specified value
# reverse() Reverses the order of the list
# sort() Sorts the list
# '''

# # Let's append our favorite color to this list

# colors = ['red', 'blue', 'green']
# colors.append('gray')
# print(colors)

# # Let's remove all the elements from the list

# colors.clear()
# print(colors)

# # Let's copy this list

# animals = ['dog', 'cat', 'bird', 'fish']
# animals_copy = animals.copy()

# animals_copy.append('white_tiger')
# print(animals)
# print(animals_copy)

# # Let's count the occurrences of 7 in this list

# numbers = [1, 2, 3, 3, 7, 7, 7, 7]
# seven_count = numbers.count(7)
# print(seven_count)


# # Let's count the occurrences of apple in this list

# fruits = ['apple', 'grapes', 'apple', 'apple']
# fruit_count = fruits.count('apple')
# print(fruit_count)

# # Let's add elements to a list from another list with extend

# movies = ['Back to the Future', 'Big', 'Lion King']
# other_movies = ['Sparkle', 'Sarafina']
# movies.extend(other_movies)
# print(movies)

# # Let's return the index of Lion King
# my_index = movies.index('Lion King')
# print(my_index)

# # Let's insert Shawshank Redemption as second item in our list

# movies.insert(1, 'shawshank Redemption')
# print(movies)
# # Let's remove the first movie

# movies.pop(0)
# print(movies)

# # Let's remove the first instance of Toyota
# cars = ['ford', 'nissan', 'toyota', 'toyota', 'chevy']
# cars.remove('toyota')
# print(cars)

# # Let's reverse our list of cars
# cars.reverse()
# print(cars)

# # Now, lets try to sort
# cars.sort()
# print(cars)

# '''
# 6. Exercise - List of Pets

# You want to make a list containing the types of pets that the user has. Keep prompting the user 
# for a pet until they enter "stop". If it's a new pet, add it to the list. If the list already has 
# that pet, don't add it.
# '''

# pet_list = [] #this will capture user input for our pets 

# while True:
#   user_input = input("Please enter your pet's name ").lower()

#   if user_input == 'stop':
#     break
#   elif user_input not in pet_list:
#     pet_list.append(user_input)
#     print(f'We have just added {user_input} is already in pets list')
#     print(pet_list)
#     continue
# print("Have a great day")                    


# '''
# 7. Example - Removing Values
# You have a list of numbers, but it contains multiple of the number 2. Remove the number 2 until 
# it only appears in the list once.

# '''

# remove_dupes = [1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 5, 6, 5]

# for c in remove_dupes:
#   if remove_dupes.count(2) > 1: #as long as there is more than one "2", will keep runnnig
#     remove_dupes.remove(2) #will remove 2, everytime we go through this loop 
# print(remove_dupes)


# '''
# 8. Exercise: Removing All Duplicates

# You have a list storing important data for your company, but it contains some duplicate entries. 
# Go through your list and remove all the duplicates. When you're done, each item should appear in 
# the list exactly once.
# Hint: How would you expand our previous example, which removed duplicates of one value, to remove 
# duplicates of all values?
# Hint 2: You might want to make a copy of the original list to use as reference. 
# You may want to use more than one loop.

# '''

# # original list
states = ['alaska', 'alaska', 'alaska', 'alabama', 'alabama', 'new york', 'new york', 'new york']
new_states = states.copy() #a copy, so we don't modify our original list

states_no_duplicates = [] #this list here will capture our unique states

for s in new_states:
  if s not in states_no_duplicates: 
    states_no_duplicates.append(s)
print(states_no_duplicates)
